### casing ###
The source files, ".fcstd" in FreeCAD_src/ are source files created by & for editing by [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/) which is free & open-source, available for Windows + Mac + Linux.

The intermediate and result files ".stl" are the standard data-transmission format for sending to a 3-D printing service.

The casing is split into components (intermediate/) to make the design more modular & hence more manageable. These components are assembled to make a final model (result/pip_box_assembly.stl).

Visual renders of each component are also available in rendered/ in .png format.

Here is the list of components that you'll need in order to constuct a Pip.

**Pip:**

+ 3D Printed Casing (£35.61 from [i.materialise](https://i.materialise.com/creationcorner))
+ [Light Blue Bean Microcontroller](https://punchthrough.com/bean/)
+ [Piezo Buzzer](http://cpc.farnell.com/pro-signal/abi-033-rc/piezo-buzzer-pcb/dp/LS03803?in_merch=Featured%20Products)
+ [Battery Holder](http://cpc.farnell.com/pro-power/23vb11a/battery-holder-1xaa-150mm-lead/dp/BT03704)
+ [Big Dome Push Button](https://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/big-dome-push-button-blue.html?gclid=CJztspP-zMICFYHLtAodjioAZQ)
+ 4 resistors (1x10Ω, 1x100Ω, 1x1kΩ, 1x10kΩ)
+ LED in [Blue](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/visible-leds/7133968/), [Red](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/visible-leds/2285073/), or [Amber](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/visible-leds/7134018/) 
+ [Stripboard](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/stripboards/2065841/)
+ [3v AA battery](http://cpc.farnell.com/varta/craa/battery-lithium-aa-3v/dp/BT01078) (Note - this is not a normal 1.5v AA battery)
+ [Microswitch](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/microswitches/7294918/)
+ [Socket screw](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/socket-screws/0529911/)

**Miscellaneous Things:**

+ glue
+ electrical tape
+ wire
+ a couple more screws

**Tools:**

+ Soldering Iron
+ Wire cutters
+ Allen Key
+ Screw driver
+ Little spanner
+ Drill
+ Hacksaw

**Gateway:**

A laptop with an internet connection and bluetooth connectivity

\- OR -

Raspberry Pi (with wifi/ethernet connection)
Bluetooth dongle (If you don’t have a raspberry pi 3)

**Costs:**

Per pip approx £75

Most of that is:

+ £35 for 3D printing
+ £20 for the board
+ £8 for the button
+ £7 for the battery

£5 for all the other stuff (which you might have lying around anyway)

There’s a lot of opportunity to make this cheaper!
